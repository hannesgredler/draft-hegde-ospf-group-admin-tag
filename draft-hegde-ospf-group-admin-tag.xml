<section title="Introduction" anchor='intro'>
  <t> This document provides mechanisms to advertise per-node administrative  
  tags in the OSPF Router Information LSA <xref target="RFC4970"/>.
  In certain path-selection applications like for example in traffic-engineering
  or Loop Free Alternate (LFA) backup selection there is a need to tag the nodes
  based on their roles in the network and have policies to prefer or 
  prune a certain group of nodes.
  </t>
</section>

<section title='Applicability'>
    <t> For the purpose of advertising per-node administrative tags within OSPF 
    a new TLV is proposed. Because path selection is a functional set which applies
    both to TE and non-TE applications, this new TLV is carried in 
    the Router Information LSA (RI LSA) <xref target="RFC4970"/>
    </t>
</section>

<section title='Administrative Tag TLV'>
    <t> An administrative Tag is a 32-bit integer value that can be 
    used to identify a group of nodes in the OSPF domain.
    <vspace blankLines="1" />
    The new TLV defined will be carried within an RI LSA for OSPFV2 and
    OSPFV3. Router information LSA <xref target="RFC4970"/> can have link,area or AS level 
    flooding scope. Choosing the flooding scope to flood the group 
    tags are defined by the policies and is a local matter.
    <vspace blankLines="1" />
    The TLV specifies one or more administrative tag values. An OSPF
    node advertises the set of groups it is part of in the OSPF domain.
    (for example, all PE-nodes are configured with certain tag value, 
    all P-nodes are configured with a different tag value in a domain).
    The total number of admin tags that a given router can advertise in one TLV
    is restricted to 64. If more tags are needed, multiple TLVs can be added in same RI-LSA or
    in different instance of the RI LSA as defined in 
    <xref target="I-D.acee-ospf-rfc4970bis"/>.

    </t>
</section>

<section title='OSPF per-node administrative tag TLV'>
	<section title='TLV format'>
	<t>As per  <xref target="RFC4970"/>, the format of the TLVs within the body of
	an RI LSA is the same as the format used by the Traffic Engineering
	Extensions to OSPF <xref target="RFC3630"/>. 
	<vspace blankLines="1" />    
	The LSA payload consists of one or more nested Type/Length/Value
	(TLV) triplets.  The format of each TLV is:

	<section title='Elements of procedure'>
	<t>Meaning of the Node administrative tags is generally
	opaque to OSPF. Router advertising the per-node
	administrative tag (or tags) may be configured to do so
	without knowing (or even explicitly supporting)
	functionality implied by the tag.</t>

	<t>Interpretation of the tag values is
	implementation-specific. The meaning of a per-node
	administrative tag is defined by the network local policy
	and is controlled via the configuration. There are no tag
	values defined by this specification. If a receiving node does not
        understand the tag value, it ignores the TLV and floods the 
        RI LSA without any change as defined in <xref target="RFC4970"/>.</t>

	<t>The semantics of the tag order has no meaning.
	That is, there is no implied meaning to the ordering of the 
         tags that indicates a certain operation or set of operations
         that need to be performed based on the ordering.</t>

	<t>Each tag SHOULD be treated as an independent
	identifier that MAY be used in policy to perform a policy
	action.  Whether or not tag A precedes or succeeds tag B
	SHOULD not change the meaning of the tag set.</t>

	<t>To avoid incomplete or inconsistent interpretations of
	the per-node administrative tags the same tag value MUST NOT
	be advertised by a router in RI LSAs of different
	scopes. The same tag MAY be advertised in multiple RI
	LSAs of the same scope, for example, OSPF Area Border
	Router (ABR) may advertise the same tag in area-scope RI
	LSAs in multiple areas connected to the ABR.</t>

	<t>The per-node administrative tags are not meant to be
	extended by the future OSPF standards. The new OSPF
	extensions MUST NOT require use of per-node administrative
	tags or define well-known tag values. 
	Instead, the future OSPF extensions must define their own data signaling
	tailored to the needs of the feature.Node administrative tags 
	are for generic use and do not require IANA registry. Any new feature
	requiring well known tag values MAY use capability TLV as defined in
	<xref target="RFC4970"/>. </t>

	<t>Being part of the RI LSA, the per-node administrative tag
	TLV must be reasonably small and stable. In particular,
	but not limited to, implementations supporting the per-node
	administrative tags MUST NOT tie advertised tags to
	changes in the network topology (both within and outside
	the OSPF domain) or reachability of routes.</t>
	</section>
</section>

<section title='Applications'>
    <t>This section lists several examples of how implementations
    might use the Node administrative tags. These examples are
    given only to demonstrate generic usefulness of the router
    tagging mechanism. Implementation supporting this
    specification is not required to implement any of the use
    cases. It is also worth noting that in some described use
    cases routers configured to advertise tags help other routers
    in their calculations but do not themselves implement the
    same functionality.

    <list style="numbers">
    <t>Service auto-discovery
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	Router tagging may be used to automatically discover
	group of routers sharing a particular service.

	<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	For example, service provider might desire to establish
	full mesh of MPLS TE tunnels between all PE routers in
	the area of MPLS VPN network. Marking all PE routers with
	a tag and configuring devices with a policy to create
	MPLS TE tunnels to all other devices advertising this tag
	will automate maintenance of the full mesh. When new PE
	router is added to the area, all other PE devices will
	open TE tunnels to it without the need of reconfiguring
	them.
    </t>

    <t>Fast-Rerouting policy
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	Increased deployment of Loop Free Alternates (LFA) as
	defined in <xref target="RFC5286"/> poses operation and
	management challenges. <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-lfa-manageability"/> proposes
	policies which, when implemented, will ease LFA operation
	concerns.

	<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	One of the proposed refinements is to be able to group
	the nodes in IGP domain with administrative tags and
	engineer the LFA based on configured policies.

	<list style="format (%c)" hangIndent="4">
	<t>Administrative limitation of LFA scope
	    <vspace blankLines="1"/>

	    Service provider access infrastructure is frequently
	    designed in layered approach with each layer of
	    devices serving different purposes and thus having
	    different hardware capabilities and configured
	    software features. When LFA repair paths are being
	    computed, it may be desirable to exclude devices from
	    being considered as LFA candidates based on their
	    layer.

	    <vspace blankLines="1"/>

	    For example, if the access infrastructure is divided
	    into the Access, Distribution and Core layers it may
	    be desirable for a Distribution device to compute LFA
	    only via Distribution or Core devices but not via
	    Access devices. This may be due to features enabled
	    on Access routers; due to capacity limitations or due
	    to the security requirements. Managing such a policy
	    via configuration of the router computing LFA is
	    cumbersome and error prone.

	    <vspace blankLines="1"/>

	    With the Node administrative tags it is possible to
	    assign a tag to each layer and implement LFA policy
	    of computing LFA repair paths only via neighbors
	    which advertise the Core or Distribution tag. This
	    requires minimal per-node configuration and network
	    automatically adapts when new links or routers are
	    added.
	</t>
	<t>LFA calculation optimization
	    <vspace blankLines="1"/>

	    Calculation of LFA paths may require significant
	    resources of the router. One execution of Dijkstra
	    algorithm is required for each neighbor eligible to
	    become next hop of repair paths. Thus a router with a
	    few hundreds of neighbors may need to execute the
	    algorithm hundreds of times before the best (or even
	    valid) repair path is found. Manually excluding from
	    the calculation neighbors which are known to provide
	    no valid LFA (such as single-connected routers) may
	    significantly reduce number of Dijkstra algorithm
	    runs.

	    <vspace blankLines="1"/>

	    LFA calculation policy may be configured so that
	    routers advertising certain tag value are excluded
	    from LFA calculation even if they are otherwise
	    suitable.
	</t>
	</list>
    </t>

    <t>Controlling Remote LFA tunnel termination
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	<xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-remote-lfa"/> proposed
	method of tunneling traffic after connected link failure
	to extend the basic LFA coverage and algorithm to find
	tunnel tail-end routers fitting LFA requirement. In most
	cases proposed algorithm finds more than one candidate
	tail-end router. In real life network it may be desirable
	to exclude some nodes from the list of candidates based
	on the local policy. This may be either due to known
	limitations of the node (the router does accept targeted
	LDP sessions required to implement Remote LFA tunneling)
	or due to administrative requirements (for example, it
	may be desirable to choose tail-end router among
	co-located devices).

	<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	The Node administrative tag delivers simple and scalable
	solution. Remote LFA can be configured with a policy to
	accept during the tail-end router calculation as
	candidates only routers advertising certain tag. Tagging
	routers allows to both exclude nodes not capable of
	serving as Remote LFA tunnel tail-ends and to define a
	region from which tail-end router must be selected.

     <t>Mobile backhaul network service deployment
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>

      The topology of mobile backhaul network usually adopts ring topology
      to save fiber resource and it is divided into the aggregate network and 
      the access network.  Cell Site Gateways(CSGs) connects the eNodeBs and 
      RNC(Radio Network Controller) Site Gateways(RSGs)connects the RNCs. 
      The mobile traffic is transported  from CSGs to RSGs.  The network takes
      a typical aggregate traffic model that more than one access rings will
      attach to one pair of aggregate site gateways(ASGs) and more than one 
      aggregate rings will attach to one pair of RSGs.

        A typical mobile backhaul network with access rings and aggregate
        links is show in figure above. The mobile backhaul networks deploy
        traffic engineering due to the strict Service Level Agreements(SLA). 
        The TE paths may have additional constraints to avoid  passing via different 
        access rings or to get completely disjoint backup TE paths. The mobile backhaul 
        networks towards the access side change frequently due to the growing mobile
        traffic and addition of new eNodeBs. It's complex to  satisfy the requirements 
        using cost, link color or explicit path configurations.

       The node administrative tag defined in this document can be effectively used
       to solve the problem for mobile backhaul networks. The nodes in different rings
       can be assigned with specific tags. TE path computation can be enhanced to
       consider additional constraints based on node administrative tags.    </t>

    </t>
     <t>Explicit routing policy
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	Partially meshed network provides multiple paths between any two nodes in the network.
	In a data center environment, the topology is usually highly symmetric with many/all 
	paths having equal cost. In a long distance network, this is usually less the case for 
	a variety of reasons (e.g. historic, fiber availability constraints, different distances
	between transit nodes, different roles ...). Hence between a given source and destination, 
	a path is typically preferred over the others, while between the same source and another 
	destination, another path may be preferred.

We want to enforce the following high level explicitly routed policies:
- traffic from A nodes to A nodes must not go through I nodes    
- traffic from A nodes to I nodes must not go through R and T nodes

With node admin tag, we can set A (resp. I, R, T) tags on A (resp. I, R, T) nodes, and then configure
this single CSPF policy on all A nodes.
